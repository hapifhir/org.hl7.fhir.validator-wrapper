# These tests do validations using CliContext instances that are manually constructed
# equivalents to those in commonMain/kotlin/constants/Preset

# Conversely, the preset-queries.http tests will perform the same tests, but using
# the baseEngine field of the CliContext to utilize the pre-built ValidationEngine
# from the ValidationService
