The publication processes also generate a variety of xml, json and RDF schemas. You can ask the validator to validate against these as well using this option. Note that there is nothing in these schemas that is not validated directly by the engine itself anyway, so the main use for this is to see the kind of errors that would be reported from these schemas by other software.",

Identifying situations where this occurs might drive a change to the profile or cause a designer to drop an element from the instance. In other cases, the presence of the element can be fine and the information message ignored.",

  "options_flags_valid_reference_description" : "If the validator can't fetch target resources, it can at least be instructed validate that the target resource is correct. For instance, if the allowed target types are (Patient or RelatedPerson), and the reference is Group/12345, then this would be usually be an error. However this is not actually explicitly stated in the FHIR specification - a reference could be to http://some.server/somewhere - it doesn't need to look like a valid FHIR RESTful reference. In fact, it's not an error even if it happens to. So by default, the validator can assume nothing about the type of resource from the content of the reference itself. However most implementers do follow those rules - a reference to either Group/12345 or http://some-server/somwhere/Group/12345 is definitely to a Group resource. (and it's definitely recommended to follow these rules). The flag assumeValidRestReferences instructs the validator to use the type found in references that look like valid RESTful URLs when validating the type of the reference.",

The validator can't determine whether the meaning of the code makes it an inappropriate extension, or not; this requires human review. Hence, the warning. But the code may be valid - that's why extensible is defined - so in some operational uses of the validator, it is appropriate to turn these warnings off",
